# weatherAPI
This is my weather app. On this App I displayed my skills in html, css, javascript, jquery, and working with API's.
I displayed a functioning app that displays not only the tempture but other good features. 
When doing this app I had to work closely in my console. Making sure all the information regarding the cities was correct.
